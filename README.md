SMARTPUMP Application using node, react and LoDB :

    Author : Esteban Ortiz

    Application for the Challenge.
    I hope to be In Puerto Vallarta Soon finishig this (LoL)

    I had only 3 days to complete this challenge, but one of those was Christmass, so there are things to work in.

    It is fully functional.

    	Things to Improve :

    		Client : Coded in React/Node

    				 Designed using th BLOC Design Pattern.
    			     This Pattern is fully reusable, but needs refinement to really split Design from Business Logic.

    				 BLOC Pattern is mos commonly used in Flutter.

    		Server : Uses LoDB, coud use an abstraction to 	use other databases SQL or NoSQL.

    		Security :  Uses JWT at this time. Need a Full Security Review.

    		Other Improvements Needed :

    			No time to Handle the Photo of the User, I prefered to spend the shor time creating the BLOC Pattern for future use and scalability.


    		Networking :

    			Uses ports 3000 and 5000 (hardcoded), needs to be configured in a config file.

Intructions :

    Download this repository and decompress in your machine.


    Install the Server :

    		npm run install:server

    Install the Client :

    		npm run install:client

    Run the Client :

    	 npm run start:client

    Run the Server :

         npm: run start:server

    Run Client & Server Simultaneously :

    	npm run start
